            <p><b>Use Case - Ecology</b></p>
            <p>The government has initiated a pan-state programme of granting in-situ land rights to slum dwellers residing in all slums of all cities in the state. In the course of the geo-spatial and household surveys, it was discovered that there are some slums in certain cities which are partially or wholly located on land parcels categorised as forest land in revenue records.
            <br>
            <br>
            The planning department has reached an agreement of land-swapping with the forest department, wherein land-rights to slum dwellers can be granted in slums located on forest land in exchange of an equal quantum of land being transferred by the planning department to the forest land. In order to execute this transfer, both the forest department and the land revenue department require a detailed account of the amount of lands to be transferred in the case of each slum and detailed maps for the same. How to identify such forest lands accurately ? What all details should be kept in mind ? What specific outputs should be created to submit to the forest and revenue departments?
